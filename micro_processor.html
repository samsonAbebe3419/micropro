 <h1>1.MicroprocessorTecnology2022/23 </h1>
 <p>
 It’s a new year, and like clockwork, 
2022 has brought with it a plethora of new chips for laptops, desktops, phones, and more. Intel announced new CPUs for virtually every product it makes, AMD refreshed its laptop processors and graphics cards for its whole lineup and started teasing its next major desktop overhaul, and Nvidia came out swinging with the announcement its most powerful GPU yet. If you weren’t keeping up (or even if you were) it was a lot. And that was just CES: Qualcomm already announced its next-gen chips for smartphones and laptops in December,
and Samsung is teeing up a new Exynos too. And that’..............

		<h1>2. EvolutionofSensors </h1>
 <p>
 Since the first P-N-P Germanium transistor was invented in 1947,
 semiconductor laboratories and companies have been providing electronics industry with 70+ kinds of semiconductor devices for rectifying,
 amplifying, switching, memory, lighting, actuating, sensing, energy harvesting and so on. Diodes and metal-oxide-semiconductor transistors are widely used in mass volume, 
 from power management to computing, in applications ranging from consumer to industrial. Meanwhile, major sensing devices evolved mainly in specific applications such as control systems, medical instruments, and automotive. 
 The semiconductor sensor industry has carved out a specialty niche thanks to multi-principal state-of-the-art of device physics, analogue circuitry design and production technology that lies outside the traditional fabless-foundry business model.

		 <h1> 3.VacuumTube</h1>
 <p>
Alternatively called an electron tube or valve and first developed by John Ambrose Fleming in 1904. 
The vacuum tube is a glass tube with its gas removed, creating a vacuum. 
Vacuum tubes contain electrodes for controlling electron flow and were used in early computers as a switch or an amplifier. 
The picture shows a collection of different vacuum tubes used with different devices.

		 <h1> 4.ARM </h1>
 <p>
 The ARM microcontroller stands for Advance RISC Machine; it is one of the extensive and most licensed processor cores in the world. 
 The first ARM processor was developed in the year 1978 by Cambridge University, and the first ARM processor was produced by the Acorn Group of Computers in the year 1985. 
 These processors are specifically used in portable devices like digital cameras, mobile phones,
 home networking modules and wireless communication technologies and other embedded systems due to the benefits, such as low consumption,
 reasonable performance, etc.
